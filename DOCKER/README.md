# TASK- Assignment - DevOps Engineer:
- Grant github access to hiring.devops@fairphonic.com.
- And GCP Project to info@fairphonic.com as Viewer reason I could not find hiring devops as user on IAM.

## Solution: 
To achieve this task, I am going to use python(3.7.3), Pytest, GCP Kubernetes and CloudBuild (CI and CD) and exposing app via Loadbalancers. I used multiple modules which is listed below.

## Requirements

| Name |
|------|
| Python |
| Pytest |
| GKE |
| Cloudbuild |

The Code is pretty simple and easy to understand. Here we will explain the code and will describe the steps to provision it on GKE Environment.

### Read before proceed
--------------------------

It is possible to put more focus on code and fix the test cases but I did not go for that as I had to just create python CI with code coverage output. Therefore I have created DOCKER folder where two identical Dockerfile is present as mentioned below:

- Dockerfile-withFailTest
- Dockerfile-withPassTest

Both is to create same code of Fastapi container but <b>Dockerfile-withFailTest</b> one of them having all test cases which is present already by other develop. So it was failing to build the image but pytest was performing the tasks and command to create the images and fail test cases result. 
```
[root@instance-2 fastapi]# docker build -t fastapi:v1 -f DOCKER/Dockerfile-withFailTest .

The command '/bin/sh -c pytest tests/*' returned a non-zero code: 1
```

However I had to create the complete end to end CICD with working code. So I wrote simple Unittest case and ran it with same command but with different dockerfile.

```
[root@instance-2 fastapi]# docker build -t fastapi:v1 -f DOCKER/Dockerfile-withPassTest .

Now we are goot to go to create CI and deploy it to some container orchestration tool like GKE. 

1. Created <b>cloudbuild.yaml</b> for CI and <b>Deployment.yaml</b> to GKE
2. It creates images and push images to GCR to keep build images.
3. Then with the help of deployment.yaml file it deploys code to GKE env. Pleae refer the link below to check the logs.

https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/builds;region=global/6655d5cd-bd7f-4b06-9129-e150e3e9f61b?authuser=1&project=inbound-hawk-320111



## Extras
---------

Although there are multiple methods to Build and Deploy on GKE to achieve this tasks which are mentioned below..

1. CI/CD pipeline for deployment
- Configuring CI/CD in your local system and CircleCI (or some other CI/CD tool), so that anytime you push your code to a Git repository, it will get automatically deployed to Beanstalk.

2. We can also create dockerized image and provision them on EKS/GCP as Pod with deployment strategy i.e. Blue-Green/Canary/Rollout strategies 

3. With the help of Terraform/Terragrunt, Can deploy EC2/RDS/ELB/Auto-scaling and remote provisioner to deploy code on EC2.

4. Any tests to check for success or failure of the pipeline.
- We can take help for flask-unittest which is developed by Python (https://pypi.org/). A hassle free solution to testing flask application using unittest. The goal is to make test code by using a unit testing framework.
- We can also use Docker Bench for Security for scanning the image and then upload it in private Repository (ECR/GCR)

7. The project could be created in python virtual environment but I am working on local workstation where I developed the code. 


## Upcoming Version
====================
- Enable PyJWT - A Python library which allows you to encode and decode JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- Unit test cases
